This quote sums up what you should be aiming for:

>"When you do things right, people won't be sure you have done anything at all" -Futurama

In this context, the quote essentially means that when you present your solution, you want your audience to understand your solution and consider it somewhat obvious. The challenge with 'good' solutions is that they are hard to obtain, but easy to recognize.



The more simple your solution is, the easier it will be for others to accept it.  The challenge with simple solutions is that they are hard to find, but easy to recognize.


Finally, I just want to leave

>"When you do things right, people won't be sure you have done anything at all".
> -Futurama
